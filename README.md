# Fix Recruitment
Ideas to fix recruitment, starting with a summary of all that's wrong.

## Summary of what's wrong

###Problem 1 - Recruiters
Recruiters are mostly a waste of time and money - they add very little value to the supply chain
###Problem 2 - Programmers
Programmers are over-reliant on recruiters, everyone is too lazy to find and contact employers directly
###Problem 3 - Employers
Employers are over-reliant on recruiters, because they lack time and reach (audience)
###Problem 4 - Too much crap
Employers who do advertise directly face a barrage of crap from unqualified applicants and aggressive agencies alike
###Problem 5 - Sales people
The recruitment industry is so lucrative it attracts mainly sales people (rather than people with technical recruitment skill)
